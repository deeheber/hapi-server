# Hapi-Server

Experimenting with how [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/) works, so writing some simple server functionality that makes calls to [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Check out [issues](https://github.com/deeheber/hapi-server/issues) to see any planned features or open bugs.

### Directions to use
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Install [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
3. In a terminal window type `npm install`
4. `npm start` will start the server 
5. Start your local mongoDB
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/documentation` in a web browser or use an application like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make calls to the server.
