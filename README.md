# Hapi-Server

Live deployment [here](https://hapi-danielle.herokuapp.com/) 

Experimenting with how [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/) works, so writing some simple server functionality that makes calls to [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

4. `npm start` will start the server 
5. Start your local mongoDB
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/documentation` in a web browser or use an application like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make calls to the server
