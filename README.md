# Hapi-Server

Experimenting with how [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/) works, so writing some simple server functionality that makes calls to a [mongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Features coming sometime in the future:
1. Testing
2. Multiple resources
  - user schema for login ???
3. Authentication
  - protected routes
  - auth roles
